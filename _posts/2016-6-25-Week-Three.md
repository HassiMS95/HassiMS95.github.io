What you did last week?

Last week, I was able to finish the second project with my partner by running a few system tests to get the necessary results in order to recieve full credit for the project. So far, the quizzes have been getting much easier to handle with now considering the questions have been based on previous lectures more rather than content from the books. Along with attending each lecture, I have began studying for the upcoming test, which is until next week. I've been reading through the past quizzes and lecture content that we discussed before. 

Whatâ€™s in the way?

Since the project has been done, nothing seems to be in the way as of right now. Although the test has been making me feel nervous on how the structure of the test was going to be like. However, one thing that has been disturbing me much was the resulting grade for the first project. I didn't get back my grade only because it wasn't accepted into Sphere, a very peculiar software used to check and see if code is properly written. 

What will you do next week?

Next week, I will be taking the next test that I have been studying for since Wednesday of the past week. I am hoping this test is much easier than those in other classes I have taken so far. I will also try to get back with my original partner whom I had worked with for the last project. I will also try to search for other people within the class who would be interested to work with both of us for the remaining projects.

Tip of the week

Whenever you see a test that is coming up on the schedule, always start studying for the test a week before the exam. This helps many people in order to get decent grades on tests. Getting help from the professor or TA based on the material helps since they won't be able to help you understand test material on test day. If possible, try to get together with friends to create a study group in order to prepare for the exam. There is a specific reason why professors encourage people to know each other well within the first week, even if you don't know each of your classmates' names well enough.
