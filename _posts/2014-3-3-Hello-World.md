What did you do this past week?

During the past week of this class, I have been working on the first Collatz project, which has been giving me a hard time to complete and figure out how to optimize it. The algorithm was exceptionally easy to figure out. However, optimizing the program was difficult to solve in order to get accepted into Sphere. We also got started being familiar with Python, a language I have taught myself for over a year through my internship at Intel. The quizzes so far have been very difficult for me to figure out correctly considering the short time limit for each quiz.

What's in your way?

So far, I have been getting constant notifications of certain errors such as Time Limit Exceeded errors, as well as Runtime Exception errors. I have also been trying to get in contact with the TA's but they haven't been in the desired places where I'd expect them to be based on the syllabus.

What will you do next week?

Next week, I'll try to figure out how to fix the bugs I have been encountering as I attempt to finish this project on time. I will also start looking through each of the books and articles in order to study better for each quiz. I also will start looking through the next project and find a way to start early on it once I find a suitable partner.

Tip of the week:

Find every possible way to get familiar with Git and Python. It took me almost a year to master Python through my internship, yet I'm continuing to learn more about Python now here in UT.
