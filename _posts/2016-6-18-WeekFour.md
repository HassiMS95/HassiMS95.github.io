What you did last week?

  Last week, we had the test, which I have been studying for since the previous week. I'd say i didn't have a very tough time understanding the questions, except for the last few questions. They were puzzling to figure out besides knowing the basic fundamentals in creating and defining a class in python. I tried so hard to focus on that exam, given though that I was fasting on that same day, which made it tough for me throughout the day. The next class day, we had a few UT alumni who came by, discussing the general experiences and aspects of gaining an internship with this software company based on a business aspect. It was interesting knowing about the work the speakers do as employees for that company. One of them was a computer science graduate, while the other graduated with a business degree. Yet they still both managed to work for such a great company. Afterwards, we discussed about the final project of the semester, which is consisted into three different stages. I managed to meet up with my group that I'll be spending almost everyday with in the computer lab in the GDC. Luckily, I have known two of my partners within my group since before the groups were randomly created. With a theme based on soccer, due to influence of the UEFA Euro 2016, we decided to create a mobile web app, displaying different teams, players, games, and leagues that have happened before, and those within the recent years.   

Whatâ€™s in the way?

  Right now, the group and I are trying to get our other members to get connected as soon as possible to get involved in our project. That way, we won't have to press too much time in order to get things done at the last minute. Communication also seems to be the problem since I have been active on the chat we have made from Slack, and yet messages have been recieved either too late or haven't been seen by other people when necessary. I hope we can get that fixed soon, considering it would take more than effort to get done with more on this project.

What will you do next week?

  Next week, I will try to follow along on the textbook readings more closely and ahead, considering I have messed up a lot on the past quizzes. I will also try to understand more on Javascript since quiz questions have been displaying code based on that language. It shouldn't be too hard to catch up on, since I have worked with a similar language such as Java.

Tip of the week

  As soon as you get within a group, do as much as you can to get to know each person in the group. Also, do everything you can to get their contact info through any social media or other connection. Connection is very important in completing projects such as this. Why's that? Simply to get in sync with everyone else so that you are on track with everyone else in the group. In other words, you won't have to find yourself asking a bunch on questions understanding what you are supposed to do in the group.
